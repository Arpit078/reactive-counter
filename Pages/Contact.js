I love working on task automation, scripting and making backend systems for web applications. I am the creator of the JavaScript library <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arpit078/preactjs" class="link">@arpit078/preactJS<span class="bar"></span></a> that is powering this website. PreactJS is a single page application javascript library. Most of my work is open sourced and publicly available on
