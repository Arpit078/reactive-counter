    <p class="paragraph">
        The main Idea behind developing pre-react was to solve all the problems that I was facing with ReactJS while still having the goodness it offered as a single page application development library. 
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        I hated react for 
        <br>
        ‚Ä¢ No DOM manipulation access, as I was used to vanillaJS it hurt a bit
        <br>
        ‚Ä¢ No inhouse routing and required to use router tag
        <br>
        ‚Ä¢ dev server took infinity to load up.
        <br>
        ‚Ä¢ bulky boiler code only made for industry level web apps

    <p class="paragraph">
        The features included packed in this powerpacked light library are :
        <br>
        ‚Ä¢ Component based architecture and one time call on server for static resources.
        <br>
        ‚Ä¢ Inhouse hashrouting so that all routes of the website are directly accesible from the searchbar even on free tier hosting services.
        <br>
        ‚Ä¢ Automatic routing using build command, No routing tags.
        <br>
        ‚Ä¢Dom manipulation access in a single page applicationüò≤. Very handy for the vanilla JS dev looking for a SPA library.
        <br>
        ‚Ä¢ Extremely light weight and made for indie and hobby projects.
